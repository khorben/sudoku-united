# Google Breakpad support
In order to enable Breakpad support the following steps need to be performed:
1. Setup a Scratchbox environment
2. Checkout Google Breakpad it is available here http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/
3. Configure & compile in scratchbox environment (the build may fail at some point - this doesn't matter as the required utilities will still be built):
3.1 CFLAGS=-Os CXXFLAGS=-Os ./configure
3.2 make
4. Enable breakpad support in the build (e.g. by appending BREAKPAD_PATH=<root path of breakpad> to the qmake flags)
5. Enable scratchbox support in build (e.g. by appending SCRATCHBOX_PATH=<scratchbox root path>)
5. Build everything
6. Debug symbol file is automatically generated follow http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/wiki/LinuxStarterGuide to generate directory structure.
